# It incorportates the usage of following Languages:
Front-end : PHP, HTML, CSS
Back-end : MariaDB, MYSQL 
Display IDE : Codiad

# Steps to Get my Codiad + Php + CSS + MYSQL+ MariaDB Linking
So Basically, install k-mall.zip folder and login system.zip folder, also my assest folder in desktop
Open the codiad tab http://115.68.231.165/~2023951086/codiad/ (But currently, I've deleted the codiad folder so not accesable.
If password and ID is required, its on my phone
Create new folder and Add the two extracted zip folders inside this new folder 
Now edit the config.php file for k-mall.zip folder to following -> localhost, db2023951086, youngmink517@gmail.com, db2023951086
As by database ID and database name is same (For some reason, cannot create new database so using the one existing which is same as my DB ID)
Now Database and Php is connected, Codiad is like react.js npm tool that can display live changes from php
Create new database (Refer the k-mall example end. Create product and manufacturer database information for now)
Fill in the manufacturer part id and name to test out product form insert and list working fine
Create new button for login page (One to link with user-login.php from login system.zip) - You can replace with thw current weird information tab
index.php or header.php will handle this part, try and edit the reference point and name to user-login.php
Make sure to also change the user-login and registration form php file to similar as k-mall format
It is left in my (chat g-file) or you can re-modify the code 
Don't forget dbconnect and util.php linking
Create new Database for the login user part (Should be left in chat g-file)
Edit the php for home page after login, so we can go back to main menu
Now edit the index.html file header.php file to our format.

Future Plans
Create new Database for buy/buy items/table and make sure the customer information handled under user_form
Now edit the overall php files for the word symbol and descriptions
In my case, add the event page for extra part
Overall check for insert/delete/modify/search working well
Also check for extra functionality purchase and sales part.
Finally check the overall css of the files. (As currently, It looks a bit empty)
Include DB 구현 내역서, 소스코드 요약 설명서, 소스 코드.
Soucre code만 Codiad에 제출 나머지는 그냥 Kupid blackboard에 제출하면 된다.
(절대로!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ----------- Codiad Folder를 제거하면 안된다......---------------)
